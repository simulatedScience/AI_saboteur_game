"""
This module implements the Saboteur environment with advanced connectivity checking,
skip actions, and reward assignment. Connectivity is now maintained using an
incremental graph that is updated whenever a new card is placed.
This module uses Python 3.11 builtâ€‘in typehints for all function signatures.
